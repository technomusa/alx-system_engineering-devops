"""
Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles
for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.

Hint: The Reddit API uses pagination for separating pages of responses.

Requirements:

Prototype: def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])
Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied.
AKA you can add a counter, but it must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
If not a valid subreddit, return None.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.
Your code will NOT pass if you are using a loop and not recursively calling the function! This /can/ be done with a loop but
the point is to use a recursive function. :)
